What kind of information can you capture using a form? (List as many as you can) 
    Name, Email, Phone, Age, Password, gender, etc.

What types of tags can you use to create forms?
    input, button, textarea, select, option, optgroup, fieldset, label, output, etc.

What are the benefits/disadvantages of using some tags over others? 
    Tags like radio buttons & check boxes limits users answer to specific available choices.  
    Some form tags are fill in the blanks where users can input their input.  

How do you start to programmatically use the data provided by the user?
    I'm assuming that the data provided by users are stored in a database where the system 
    or company can use at their discretion.  Data stored can also help systems identify users and give users
    access to services they signed up for.
